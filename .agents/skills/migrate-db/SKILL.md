# Migrate DB

Change: the user's request

## 1. Design

- Pick the next sequential number in the project's migrations directory (follow the existing numbering; respect any gaps).
- Decide which backends/adapters the change touches.
- If it backs a cloud/enterprise feature, the table is OFF by default (master + sub-flag AND pattern).

## 2. Author

- `NNN_<slug>` migration — forward-only, idempotent (`IF NOT EXISTS`, guarded).
- Adapter-agnostic intent: a change that works on one backend but breaks the others is not done.
- **Present the migration. Wait for approval.**

## 3. Apply

- Run the project's migrate command (detect it with `.agents/tools/facts.sh`, run it under `.agents/tools/watch.sh`).
- Confirm it applied via the project's migrate-status command.

## 4. Gate

- Add or extend a verify gate (a `scripts/verify/` check or CI job) that exercises the new schema.
- A gate that passes vacuously is not a gate.

## 5. Report

Output: `docs/migrations/db-<date>.md` — the migration number, backends touched, the flag (if any), and the gate that proves it.
